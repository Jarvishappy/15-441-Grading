"When I was a child, I once asked my mother, 'Where did I come from?' 
She answered, 'Why, we all sprouted from the mushroom forest, of course.'
Nightmares soon haunted my sleep.  I dreamt that I was lost among the 
toadstools.  I woke in tears, but felt the warmth of my mother's embrace
as she comforted me.  It is something I still remember to this day."
